# 🩸 Blood Management System

The **Blood Management System** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of managing blood donations, inventory, and donor data. Built with the **MERN stack** — React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB — the system offers a real-time view of blood availability across connected centers.

This project integrates with **government APIs** to enable accurate and up-to-date **donor tracking**, supporting healthcare infrastructure and improving emergency response. The system is deployed on **Heroku**, with **GitHub Actions** configured for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), ensuring reliable and seamless updates.
